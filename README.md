# Process is Everything - Lead By Example
With process, drive, and dedication a group of individuals can do amazing things.   We believe process is everything; and it provides certainty and stability to our projects as our reputation as designers and developers at OpenForge.

This document (and series of documents) contains the responsibilities of each team member and position within our team.  Please follow this guide, ask questions along the way, and contribute as you see areas for improvement.  Just like our team and the technology we use, our process is constantly evolving to become better and more efficient as we grow as individuals.

# Starting Design Process
In order to guarantee success when building a project on time and on budget (scope), we have a rigorous Discovery and Design process that includes members of the Design, Development, QA, and Business teams.

If you're starting the [Discovery & Design Process, Start Here.](https://github.com/openforge/Standards/tree/master/design-process)

# Starting Development Process
Prior to kicking off development on a new project, you will need to gather the requirements for the project you'll be working on. If you are the point person, be sure to send the client the [New Project Questionaire](https://github.com/openforge/Standards/blob/master/dev-process/new-project-questionaire.md).  This document will be your guide to figuring out all necessary dependencies & specifics for your project.

# Project Management Process
We have taken inspiration from Henry Ford to make the process of Application development as straight forward as possible.  With that said, our Project Management requirements are streamlined as well.

If you are Project Manager, [you can find your instructions here!](https://github.com/openforge/Standards/blob/master/project-management/README.md)

# Quality Assurance Process
Quality Assurance is a very important aspect of a Project, and we have a section dedicated to this process for anyone who's responsible for this task.

If you are Quality Assurance Engineer, [you can find your instructions here!](https://github.com/openforge/Standards/blob/master/quality-assurance/README.md)
