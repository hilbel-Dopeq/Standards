# Purpose 

Often we'll be working with non-technical business owners or founders who do not share our same experiences.  They'll be learning from us, and we'll be learning from them.

This means however; that when they create their requirements they may not provide all of the relevant information because *they don't know all of the questions to ask*

The Purpose of this document is to ask questions they may not have thought of, in an effort to transparently lay out all of the relevant information for a project's success.
