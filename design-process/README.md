# Where to Start

The solutions we build as a team require planning, foresight, experience, and most importantly - Collaboration.   It's part of our process to teach our clients as we learn from them.  

To accomplish this, we divide our Design Process into two distinct phases:   Discovery & Design

# Discovery

## What Is Discovery?

The Discovery process is a series of exercises, workshops, and collaborative meetings that we have with our clients to determine some critically important decisions.  These include:

1. LEAN Canvas (Consulting)
2. User Flows (Quality Management)
3. Feature Pyramid (Consulting & Dev Member)
4. Key Metrics & User Feedback Loop (Design & Consulting)
5. Startup Consulting

Add-ons

6. User Aquisition Strategy (Consulting)
7. Language & SEO (Consulting & Marketing)

## Deliverables

At the conclusion of Discovery, before Design starts - we should have provided to the client all of the above, in addition to the following requests sent to client

* Look & Feel Questionnaire
* [Dev Requirement Questionnaire](https://github.com/openforge/Standards/blob/master/dev-process/questionnaire/dev-questionnaire.md)

# Design 

The Design Phase is lead by the Design Lead appointed to a client's project.   The Design Lead is responsible for maintaining design & user experience consistency across the application;  scoping and updating new iterations, and responding to design related questions via Teamwork.

The main activities (in order)

1. Send Design Questionaire
2. Create User Persona(s) & Journey for all User Types
3. Suggestions & Review of User Flows w/ Client 
4. Framework Selection w/ Dev Point (Ionic, Bootstrap)
5. Create Greyscale Wireframes 
    * 3 screens at a time
6. Schedule Dev Review 
    * Recap to Client
7. Create Color Palette & Logo
8. Apply color palette
    * Review with client for one flow.
9. Finish Flows

*** Every design sent to client is sent through Marvel/AdobeXD***


## Deliverables

* Sketch File (See below for examples)
    * Symbol File - Contains all base screens 
    * Overview - Contains screens, categorized by feature
    * User Flow - Wireframes - Wireframes broken out into specific user flows
    * User Flows - Designed - Replacing of existing symbol files to contain new designs.
* Marvel Link
    * Password Protected
    * Versioned (every update, use [SEMVER](https://semver.org/))
    * Clickable Prototype of Designs


# Next - Development Phase!

See [instructions for development phase](https://github.com/openforge/Standards/tree/master/dev-process) in the Dev-Process readme.

Congratulations!  The design process is now complete until the next iteration is requested.
