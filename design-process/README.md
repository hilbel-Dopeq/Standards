# Where to Start

The solutions we build as a team require planning, foresight, experience, and most importantly - Collaboration.   It's part of our process to teach our clients as we learn from them.  

To accomplish this, we divide our Design Process into two distinct phases:   Discovery & Design

# Discovery

## What Is Discovery?

The Discovery process is a series of exercises, workshops, and collaborative meetings that we have with our clients to determine some critically important decisions.  These include:

1. LEAN Canvas
2. User Personas
3. User Flows
4. Key Metrics & User Feedback Loop
5. User Aquisition Strategy
6. Language & SEO
7. Feature Pyramid
8. Wireframes (Using Sketch & Bootstrap, Ionic, or React Components)

## Who's Involved?

The Discovery Process involves 3-4 stakeholders

1. Business Strategy
    * Jedi
2. Email Marketing Strategy & Account Management
    * Geoff
3. Design Lead
    * Rachel

## Deliverables

At the conclusion of Discovery, before Design starts - we should have provided to the client all of the above, in addition to the following requests sent to client

* Look & Feel Questionnaire
* [Dev Requirement Questionnaire](https://github.com/openforge/Standards/blob/master/dev-process/questionnaire/dev-questionnaire.md)

# Design 

The Design Phase is lead by the Design Lead appointed to a client's project.   The Design Lead is responsible for maintaining design & user experience consistency across the application;  scoping and updating new iterations, and responding to design related questions via Teamwork.

The main activities are

* Color Palette 
* Base Framework Selection (Ionic, React, Bootstrap, other)
* OpenForge Logo Design
* User Flow Review
* Design Iterations
     * Provide 3-4 screens for review; receive feedback before continuing
* Design Review w/ Development Team for Scoping Updates
* After Reviewed w/ Dev Team, Upload to Marvel for Client Approval

## Deliverables

* Sketch File (See below for examples)
    * Symbol File - Contains all base screens 
    * WireFrame Overview - Contains screens, categorized by feature
    * User Flow Wireframes - Wireframes broken out into specific user flows
    * Designed User Flows - Replacing of existing symbol files to contain new designs.
* Marvel Link
    * Password Protected
    * Versioned (every update, use [SEMVER](https://semver.org/))
    * Clickable Prototype of Designs

# Next - Development Phase!

See [instructions for development phase](https://github.com/openforge/Standards/tree/master/dev-process) in the Dev-Process readme.

Congratulations!  The design process is now complete until the next iteration is requested.  Don't forget to update version numbers!
