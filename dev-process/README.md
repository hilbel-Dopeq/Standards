# What to do

If you're reading this, it means you're part of our team or simply curious about our process.  Thank you for that :)  Let's dive into the dev process!


## Discovery & Design Phase (Business Requirements)

The first step in scoping a project is understanding the requirements.   At OpenForge, we involve both design and developers equally in our process.  In a typical project, a dev is responsible for:

1. Send client [The Dev Questionaire](https://github.com/openforge/Standards/blob/master/dev-process/questionnaire/dev-questionnaire.md)
2. Review App & Questionare w/ Design Lead
3. Annotated designs w/ Design Lead

## Development Phase

1. Verify all account access has been received with [Project Manager](https://github.com/openforge/Standards/tree/master/project-management), if not see details at [The Dev Questionaire](https://github.com/openforge/Standards/blob/master/dev-process/questionnaire/dev-questionnaire.md)
2. Initialize Repository w/ template
3. Copy README from [OpenForge.io README](https://github.com/openforge/OPENFORGE.IO)
4. Setup all Standards 
  * Commitizen, Gitflow, etc
5. Setup Github/Heroku/TravisCI Continuous Integration Strategy
  * Development
  * QA (Optional)
  * Production
6. Scaffold App & Setup Routing for Team contributions
