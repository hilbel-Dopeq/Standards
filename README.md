# What is this?
A simple procedural guide for developing applications the OpenForge way. This is the starting point for the development phase of every project.

# What do you need to get started?
Prior to kicking off development on a new project, you will need to gather the dev-requirements[LINK: dev-requirements template doc] for the specific project that you're working on. That document will be your guide to figuring out all necessary dependencies & specifics for your project.

# Let's Kick off Dev Work
Refer to your project's dev-requirements to find answers to the following questions, and follow the appropriate links to get to where you need to be. Now, we are officially kicking off dev, WHOOO!
